# Predictive-Modelling-of-NBA-Sports-League
This Project Analysis some of the problems with NBA league and provides an alternate solution to fix those problems
The dataset that has been used in this Group project is “Enhanced NBA Statistics 2012-2018”. In this the
dataset is described in three point of views.
   1) the player’s point of view
   2) the team’s point of view
   3) Official’s point of view
Also, the salary dataset was used to calculate the salary of each player.

The Dataset links are:

Data manipulation: All the following tables were merged together to form a master table through which
all variables were calculated and analysed. Some of the values had to be transformed to make the data
more interactive.

Data cleaning: The dataset had a few problems, while merging with the salary table a index had to
evaluated through which each player’s salary could be merged.

In some Cases, the games were duplicated ( for eg: GSW game). Through thorough analysis it was referred
that the dataset actually wanted to convey home/away fixtures. This was cleaned through introducing
home/away variable.

Although, the data is highly accurate but still the data was checked for outliers and missing values and if
founded they were treated.
